 <h1>Nick's Favorite Movies!</h1>
 <h2>My favorite movies of all time</h2>

 <hr />

 <h3>The Dark Knight</h3>
 <p>I love how the story is told. It's got great music, and the Joker is a fantastic villain.</p>
 <h3>The Blues Brothers</h3>
 <p>This is the movie that taught me to be a musician. Or rather, taught me how to approach gigging and playing music with less of a serious attitutde.</p>
 <h3>Star Wars: Return of the Jedi</h3>
 <p>This is such a great ending to the trilogy. It ties up the stories really well, reveals some long term motives and secrets, and is very fun to watch.</p>
